# ServeDoctor
The ServeDoctor is a computer application that analyzes tennis serve techniques using footage of the players in action. The application's interface was created through KIVY, a cross-platform python framework for GUI development. The application detects the moment the players hit the serve - point of contact. Then it detects the location of their joints - shoulders, wrists, elbows, etc. . Following that, it creates a model of the players body in space, and uses that to analyze the player's technique and compare it to the ideal technique. The application was implemented in my home country of Sudan since coaching is mainly unaffordable there.
