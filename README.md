# ServeDoctor
The ServeDoctor is a computer application that analyzes tennis serve techniques using footage of the players in action. The application's interface was created through KIVY, a cross-platform python framework for GUI development. The application detects the moment the players hit the serve - point of contact. Then it detects the location of their joints - shoulders, wrists, elbows, etc. . Following that, it creates a model of the players body in space, and uses that to analyze the player's technique and compare it to the ideal technique. The application was implemented in my home country of Sudan since coaching is mainly unaffordable there.

The tech.kv file is the one which brings everything together using the KIVY user interface to create the of the application. Then the main.py file is the one which analyzes the footage to find when the players contacted the ball in their serve motion. Finally, the pose.py file is the one which detects the player's joints's positions using deep learning. And from that it calculates the different joint angles to gain an understanding of how effective the player's technique it.
